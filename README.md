# Employee Manager Automation


## Overview:

An employee management application is being tested to determine its ability to keep track of employee ids, names, phone numbers, and titles, as well as changes to those categories(except employee id).

The application is also able to filter employees by name, title, and phone number. New employees can be added as well.

The information stored in the application will be saved in a database. Users should be able to find their changes saved when they open the application in a new window.
